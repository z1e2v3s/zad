What
----

In times of DNSsec, edited zone files interfere with resigning activities of
the nameserver. To avoid inconsistency, zones can be maintained by dynamic update
(RFC 2136).
zad provides a GUI for dynamic updates and zone visualisation to make address
and host name editing easy and even easier than file editing.
